# Rusty Template agent guidance

Rusty Template is a minimal C# counter product and starting point for downstream
Rusty Engine projects. Keep it small enough to understand and customize.

> The product decides. The Engine guarantees.

## Start here

Read [README.md](README.md) for setup and commands and
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the current owners. Before
changing the Engine boundary, read the Engine's `AGENTS.md`,
`docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/csharp-sdk.md` in an explicitly identified
source checkout (locally, `../rusty-engine`). Source is reference material;
ordinary builds consume the installed package. Verify capabilities against the
pinned SDK rather than assuming the source checkout and package are identical.

The user request and owning task define scope and acceptance. If work is tied
to Den, resolve that project's live guidance, task, and dependencies. Report
failed reads; do not invent task state. Continue independently authorized work
and pause only decisions that need unavailable authority.

## Ownership and source

- `src/RustyTemplate.Game/` owns counter state, application policy, semantic
  input interpretation, and UI facts. Organize additions by product domain;
  keep the product entry focused on explicit composition and lifecycle.
- `Rusty.Engine` owns named Engine mechanisms: lifecycle/update admission,
  input delivery, rendering/resources, spatial queries, content delivery,
  persistence primitives, and host integration. Search the safe SDK and
  existing product owners before adding a mechanism.
- `src/ui/` is a DOM companion. It observes Engine projections and submits
  semantic intents. Gameplay state, game rendering, canvas, transport, and
  scheduling stay with their C#/Engine owners.
- `content/` holds product-authored data. Interpret it in typed C# through
  Engine content services. Keep authored definitions, live state, and transient
  presentation distinct.
- The SDK generates composition and interop under ignored `obj/` output.
  Product code stays safe C#: no handwritten ABI/PInvoke, exports, raw native
  access, downstream Rust, or checked-in composition projects.

There is one Engine-admitted update path. Use its time/input facts; do not add
another loop, clock, scheduler, renderer, or state authority downstream.

## Product style

Prefer ordinary readable C#, explicit composition, direct methods, and one
clear mutable owner per domain. Keep operations thin: read, decide, apply,
publish. Use typed boundaries where they help; do not introduce a framework,
reflection discovery, generic bus, or service locator for hypothetical needs.

Use nullable types, file-scoped namespaces, and `internal`/`sealed` defaults
where the public product contract does not require otherwise. Keep structural
constants beside their algorithm; give meaningful identities names. Put
adjustable gameplay values and authored definitions in domain-owned content
when the product needs tuning, rather than hiding them in call sites.

Trust first-party runtime state and Engine-admitted data. Preserve concrete
eligibility rules, current-data errors, and resource lifetime/disposal. Do not
add repeated hashing, compatibility layers, whole-state rollback, or validation
ceremony without a task-owned failure it prevents. Save meaningful values at
explicit save boundaries; native handles and presentation resources are not
product save state.

## Engine dependencies and gaps

`Directory.Build.props` owns the exact SDK/runtime pin. Install it with
`./scripts/install-engine.sh`; deliberately advance it with
`./scripts/install-engine.sh --update`, then run the focused checks. Keep exact
versions in executable configuration and evidence, not duplicated in prose.
Normal development uses the matched runtime pack through `rusty dev`.
NativeAOT is an explicit fidelity/release check. Do not make an adjacent
Engine checkout a build dependency or modify it as part of downstream work.

If a required mechanism is missing, verify the safe API, name the blocked
behavior and upstream owner, and file/link one narrow Engine request when
that is authorized. Distinguish a missing mechanism or binding from a helper
or documentation gap. Stop that dependent slice; continue independent work.
Do not conceal the gap with a local substitute, fake success, or proof-only path.

## Review and evidence

Use [docs/agent-review/README.md](docs/agent-review/README.md). Every change gets
an Engine-reuse and existing-product-reuse check; trivial changes may record
that no mechanism is affected. Assign bounded independent lanes when review
agents are requested or the task's review workflow calls for them. Keep the
same reviewer for fix rounds and reconcile source-backed findings against the
original task. Review is not an extra user-approval gate.

`./scripts/build-csharp.sh` builds and stages the ordinary CoreCLR product.
`./scripts/build-csharp.sh --aot` additionally publishes NativeAOT. Use focused
semantic or interaction evidence only when it answers the changed behavior;
do not add broad test gates to this small template. Distinguish build/staging,
host launch, and visible interaction claims. Repeat passed checks only after
material changes or an unresolved failure.

Preserve unrelated edits. Keep generated output and installed artifacts
ignored. Do not reset, force-push, or change adjacent repositories. Report what
changed, relevant checks, and concrete limitations. Commit/push when requested
or authorized by the active task; a review packet does not authorize publishing.
