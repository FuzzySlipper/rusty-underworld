# Product architecture

> The product decides. The Engine guarantees.

```text
Counter state and policy (C#)
  -> Rusty.Engine safe SDK
  -> SDK-generated composition and ABI
  -> packaged Rust host, input, UI transport, and browser shell
  -> DOM companion
```

## Owners

| Path or service | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/RustyTemplate.Game/Counter/CounterState.cs` | Counter value, increment saturation, and reset policy |
| `src/RustyTemplate.Game/RustyTemplateProduct.cs` | Lifecycle callbacks, semantic input interpretation, and counter projection |
| `src/RustyTemplate.Game/RustyTemplate.Game.csproj` | Explicit product entry, content/UI roots, intents, and host defaults |
| `src/ui/main.js` | DOM button/label, intent submission, projection subscription, and UI cleanup |
| `content/` | Product-authored data |
| Engine SDK/runtime | Generated interop, admitted updates/input, retained UI transport, host, renderer, and browser shell |

## Lifecycle and data flow

The installed runtime loads SDK-generated CoreCLR composition. Its bind checks
the SDK/runtime ABI identity and constructs the product with
`ProductCreateContext`. The product opens its UI stream through `IEngineContext.Ui`.

Engine calls `Start` and admits `ProductUpdate` callbacks. The DOM button
submits the declared `increment` intent. C# interprets active direct-digital
input, updates its counter, and publishes a typed `UiValue`. The DOM observes
that projection and displays its number; it holds no authoritative counter.

Engine owns pause/resume/restart/shutdown admission. Product callbacks apply
local policy, such as resetting the counter on restart. Disposal releases the
UI stream. Resource lifetimes and admitted update facts remain Engine-owned.

## Build and host

`Directory.Build.props` selects one immutable SDK/runtime pair. The installer
uses the release's verifier; `NuGet.Config` points at its installed SDK feed.
The product's package reference supplies the public services and build targets.
Generated bindings and composition are ignored output, never edited sources.

The build script compiles and stages CoreCLR through
`StageRustyEngineCoreClrProduct`. The run script invokes the matching pack's
`rusty dev`, which owns staging, watching, worker replacement, and serving.
`VerifyRustyEngineAot` publishes NativeAOT for explicit fidelity/release checks.
The product supplies only its C#, DOM UI, and content; browser assets and
transport come from the runtime pack.

Before adding a mechanism, check both the installed safe SDK and the owners
above. Product meaning stays downstream. A missing Engine capability is an
upstream request, not another local host, transport, scheduler, or renderer.
