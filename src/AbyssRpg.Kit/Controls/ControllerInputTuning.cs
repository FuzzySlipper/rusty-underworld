/// <remarks>
/// The Engine names controller axes and buttons by position — <c>ControllerAxis.Axis0..Axis3</c> and
/// <c>ControllerButton.Button0..Button15</c> — because it carries no device knowledge. Which index is
/// a stick, which way that stick points, and what a button means are product policy, so they are
/// tuning rather than constants: another pad is a configuration change, not a rebuild.
/// <para>
/// The browser shell delivers the standard gamepad layout, in which the left stick is axes 0 and 1,
/// the right stick is axes 2 and 3, and both vertical axes are positive downwards. Planar intent is
/// positive forward and camera pitch is positive upward, so both vertical axes are inverted by
/// default. Deadzones are per axis and preserve direction while rescaling the live range to the full
/// unit travel, so a stick that has just left the deadzone is a slow move rather than a jump to it.
/// </para>
